title: "Alerting when answers change on Google Drive"
description: "Ask questions about your private data (docs), and tell the app to alert you whenever responses change. The app is always connected to your Google Docs folder and listening for changes. Whenever new relevant information is added to the data sources, the LLM decides if there is a substantial difference in response and notifies the user with a Slack message."
