# Build an LLM App with Pathway

Pathway core framework and its LLM xpack are the core technology behind [Pathway RAG app](/developers/ai-pipelines/welcome).

You can learn how to easily design and implement LLM apps using Pathway in [this tutorial](/developers/ai-pipelines/create-your-own).

If you prefer to run an existing pipeline, check out all LLM and RAG examples on our [App Templates page](/developers/templates?category=llm#llm).
